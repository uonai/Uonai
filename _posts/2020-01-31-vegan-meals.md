Last week, I did a meal tracking exercise because Ian (Twitter: @ianjbattaglia) wanted to see exactly what I ate each day. I didn't photograph everything but did document as much as I could. 

- All protein used was SunWarrior Chocolate Protien (primarily Pea Protein)
- I did prep eight meals, 4 Korean Miso Tofu meals, and 4 Spaghetti and Meatball meals, pictured below.

Each day provided roughly 150g of protein and the calories did vary slightly. I tend to cook without oil and use an air fryer or steamer for most preparation.
