# The First Fifteen Minutes

Most creative tasks I've taken on have consistently had shaky starts. Writing, Music, Coding.

I find that the first fifteen minutes of creative tasks are the most difficult. The process of staring down at a blank page, or a blank screen. Tuning imperfection from an instrument and warming up the voice.

These first fifteen minutes are the most uncomfortable. The process of going inward and dedicating attention to a single activity. They function to me as the make or break period. If I can get through the first fifteen minutes of writing, I'm generally off to a good start. With enough dedication and free time, I'm then capable of going for 30 - 45 minutes more before burning out. Maybe even longer.

I treat these first fifteen minutes as a warmup, like stretching or Kata. I dedicate as much capacity as I can to focusing on the task at hand. During this period I know that I won't be able to produce anything meaningful.

Some of my most creative experiences have been when I take the first fifteen minutes of the day to warm up with writing. Rolling out of bed and writing freely for is my favorite way of warming up to the day. Mental stretching.
