# The First Fifteen Minutes

Every creative task I've ever taken on has had a shaky start: Writing, Music, Coding.

The first fifteen minutes of creative tasks are the most difficult. They function as the make or break period. If I can get through the first few minutes of writing, I'm generally off to a good start and capable of going for 30 - 45 minutes more before burning out. Maybe even longer.

However, they are incredibly painful. I treat them like a warmup, like stretching. I dedicate one hundred percent focus to the task at hand but know that I won't be able to produce anything meaningful.
